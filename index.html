  Welcome to my website! I'm glad you found it. Here I will share the projects 
  that I have worked on recently. There will be roughly equal parts academic, 
  personal and professional projects. Have a look around and send me an e-mail 
  if you want to get in touch.

    The computers that we use on a daily basis, would have been considered 
    supercomputers not so long ago. So, what can we do with our supercomputers 
    (besides scrolling Instagram)? Do awesome simulations! The animations you 
    see below/on the right are calculated in real-time inside your browser. They 
    show off some of my interests and recent projects.

      A simulated lattice of uncoupled photon Bose-Einstein Condensates. For my 
      master thesis, I worked on an experimental realization of this lattice.
